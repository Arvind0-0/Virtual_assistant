# **AI Virtual Assistant **  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This is an **AI-powered virtual assistant** that can:  
✅ Understand **natural language commands** using **BERT**  
✅ Understand tasks like **setting reminders, scheduling meetings, and checking weather**  

---

## **📌 Features**
🔹 **NLP-Based Task Execution** → Uses **BERT** to understand user commands  
🔹 **SQLite Database** → Stores reminders and meetings  
🔹 **Flask API** → Backend to process requests  
🔹 **Streamlit UI** → User-friendly web app

## **📌 How It Works**
### **1️⃣ Training the Model**
- The model is saved as **`model.pkl`** for later use  

### **2️⃣ Running the AI Assistant (Web + API)**
✅ **Start the backend API**  
```bash
python backend.py
```
✅ **Start the web interface**  
```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

## **📌 Dependencies**
Install all required libraries using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For downloading model.pkl file
